# Composer

This docker image of composer contains composer with the most used 
php extensions.

I use composer on every new project directly from a docker container 
and I'm tired of building a new docker image every time a package 
needs an extension.

If I forget an extension, feel free to open a pull request or ticket 
to add it.
